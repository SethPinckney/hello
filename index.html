        <p>We will need to add some content here explaining what MyArtWorks is, who can use it, and how. The writing that appears on the web is known as content. Over the next 3-4 weeks we will need to plan out what the website should look like. What is the brand of our new social network "MyArtWorks.Me." We will do this with a process called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0vt3nLZKks&noredirect=1">Wireframing.
